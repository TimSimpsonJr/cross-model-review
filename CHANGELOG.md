## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-29

### Added

- Three skills:
  - `codex-plan-review` (handles design-review and plan-review modes).
  - `codex-impl-review` (post-implementation diff review).
  - `codex-brainstorm-partner` (Codex stands in for user during brainstorming).
- Seven slash commands: `cross-model-autonomous-on`, `-autonomous-off`,
  `-skip`, `-review-now`, `-setup`, `-status`, `-reset`.
- Two Stop-event backup-nudge rules for lifecycle moments where the
  corresponding skill failed to fire. Delivered as hookify rule files
  (`.claude/hookify.cross-model-{plan,impl}-review.local.md`) installed
  into the host project by `/cross-model-setup`. Native Claude Code Stop
  hooks don't support transcript-pattern matchers, so hookify is the
  Layer 3 carrier; the plugin works without it (Layers 1+2 still
  operate), but backup nudging requires hookify to be installed.
- Per-project durable session state at `.claude/cross-model-review.session.local.md`.
- Per-chain decisions log at `.claude/cross-model-review/decisions/<artifact-basename>.md`.
- Design / plan doc frontmatter as cross-machine resume bridge
  (`codex_thread_id`, approval status, approval hashes).
- Universal Codex priming sent once per project.
- `[MODE: <kind>]` and `[CHAIN-BOUNDARY]` markers for clean role-switching
  inside long-lived Codex threads.
- Trigger-biased code-detection heuristic with per-project CLAUDE.md
  override notes for mixed-content repos.
- Autonomous mode with three-outcome decision model (resolve / defer / halt).
- Hash-based approval invalidation that downgrades downstream approvals
  when artifacts are edited.
